# Solution to the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges in FCC
The following challenges are part of FCC's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges. These should prepare you to complete the final challenges for the JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification.

These challenges will allow you to test how much you have learned and which parts you may need to review again before starting the projects.

# Sum All Numbers in a Range
We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.

For example, sumAll([4,1]) should return 10 because sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is 10. https://github.com/InfoTechDrive/Intermediate-Algorithm-Scripting/blob/master/Sum%20All%20Numbers%20in%20a%20Range.js
